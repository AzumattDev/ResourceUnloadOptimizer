# Description

## Improves loading times and reduces or eliminates stutter in Valheim each time they use Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets and/or GC.Collect.

As of Mistlands, the game began to stutter a lot more than it used to. This mod is an attempt at fixing this issue. The most recent patch notes (version 0.213.4) to the game states "Periodic lag spike fix (Resource unloading will now run while sleeping or pausing afk for 5 seconds if it hasn't been run for a 20 minutes, or when calling "cr" from console, or if none of those things, every 60 minutes)" 
Although one would think this would fix the issue, it doesn't, it only makes it less frequent. Using this mod will hopefully make even the less frequent stutters go away or be greatly reduced.

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

### This mod is recommended to be installed on both the server and client, but isn't required. Install it on clients or servers that seem to be having stuttering or long load times.`
