# Description

## Improves loading times and reduces or eliminates stutter in Valheim each time they use Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets and/or GC.Collect.


`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly in the configuration file, the mod will reload the configuration live.`


### This mod is recommended to be installed on both the server and client, but isn't required. Install it on clients or servers that seem to be having stuttering or long load times.`
